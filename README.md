This procurement department activity project that I utilize Tableau to design data dashboards with the extracted data sources, including activity start dates, supply costs, and supply analysis. The data visualizations include Gantt and line charts to present all data findings for each buyer's activity from 2022 to 2026. 

Part 1:
•	View1: Design a Gantt chart to appropriately represent the selected buyer, item, PO Date, PO quantity, PO Amount, and key performance indicator (KPI) financial metrics, such as cost, savings, or expenditure.

•	View2: Create a data summary report and the extracted data statements for stakeholders.

Part 2:
•	View1: Design a line chart that visualizes all selected purchase item values and calculations with KPIs shown in dollar values.

•	View2: Allow for viewing each buyer’s purchase datasets by clicking on a single line.

Part 3:
•	View1: Design a purchasing volume analysis to represent which buyer has the highest purchasing volume compared to other buyers.

•	View2: By selecting the top buyer in the procurement department, it provides detailed purchase data for all activities over the past five years.

This project includes several basic data visualizations created purely for this Tableau's feature demonstration example only.In real-time Boeing's supply chain operation systems, data visualization depends on the requesting department, the underlying SAP-integrated system configuration, and the specific topic and  matter that requires visualization to design for a view  the relevant system data .

Thank you for review and question.
