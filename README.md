This procurement department activity project that I utilize Tableau to design data dashboards with extracted data sources, including activity start dates, supply costs, and supply analysis. The data visualizations include Gantt and line charts to represent all data findings for each buyer's activity from 2022 to 2026. 
There are three parts for data visualization representation as follows:

Part 1:
•	View1: Designs a Gantt chart to appropriately represent the selected buyer, item, PO Date, PO quantity, PO Amount, and key performance indicator (KPI) financial metrics, such as cost, savings, or expenditure.
•	View2: Creates a data summary report or full extracted data statements for stakeholders.
Part 2:
•	View1: Designs a line chart that visualizes all selected purchase item values and calculates KPIs shown in dollar values.
•	View2: Allows for viewing each buyer’s purchase datasets by clicking on a single line.
Part 3:
•	View1: Designs a purchasing volume analysis to represent which buyer has the highest purchasing volume compared to other buyers.
•	View2: By selecting the top buyer in the procurement department, it provides detailed purchase data for all activities over the past five years.

The data visualization design is for demonstration purposes only. In work cases, I will base on the extracted data sources to determine the appropriate variables, dimensions, and metric calculations subject to which type of chart type for data finding representation to stakeholder. 
Thank you for reviewing this project. Any comments for further development are welcome.
